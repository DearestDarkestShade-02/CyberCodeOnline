This fragment of an object was something you found in an important looking box, in  room filled with tougher enemies. Could they have been guarding this? It seems to be a fragent of a...key? You look closer at the dusty metal and realize, yes, it is in fact, a piece of a key. You get the lingering sensation that obtaining the other pieces will be more difficult, and there is much lying ahead...it has truly only just begun.
